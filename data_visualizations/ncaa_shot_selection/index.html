            One advantage of the logarithmic scale compared to the linear scale is that with the logarithmic scale, we can see
            a lot smoother transitions from the high shot attempt areas to the lower shot attempt areas. There's a high concentration of shots
            right under the basket as that area is yellow, and it fades into light green, then green, then blue until you hit the three point line,
            where it's green again. This makes sense, as most shots come from underneath the basket, with a decreasing frequency until hitting the three point line.
            It's interesting to note how few shots happen immediately within the three point line. This, too, makes sense. If one is going to attempt a long two pointer, 
            it makes more sense to step back a foot and try for three. However, a disadvantage of using the logarithmic scale is that it slightly distorts how many shots come from
            outside the area under the basket. In the visualization using the logarithmic scale, it looks like there's only a slightly higher 
            concentration of shots near ther basket than far away from the basket (but not three pointers), but in the visualization using the linear scale,
            we can clearly see that the vast majority of shots are from right around the hoop or three point land, as those areas are solidly yellow.
